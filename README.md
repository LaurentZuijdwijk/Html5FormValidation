Html5FormValidation
===================

A complete cross-browser form validation script, either stand-alone, or as a JQuery plugin.

I aimed to make an easy to use form validation plugin, which will work in any browser and any circumstance. It is easy to use and will conform to the HTML5 spec.

If you need a lightweight and unobtrusive plugin to make your forms behave, this might be good for you.
